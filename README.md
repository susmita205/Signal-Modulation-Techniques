# Signal-Modulation-Techniques

This repository contains MATLAB simulations and experimental studies of various signal modulation and demodulation techniques performed as part of the Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) practical lab. Each experiment includes code for signal generation, demodulation, and result visualization, along with detailed reports explaining the methodology and results.
